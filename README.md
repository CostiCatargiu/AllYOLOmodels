# AllYoloModels
Hello everyone! :D
My name is Catargiu Constantin and i am studying PhD at Gheorghe Asachi University in Iasi, Romania. During my work research i started to read and learn about YOLO(You Only Look Once) models which can be used for Object detection, Tracking, Classification and Image Segmentation and also i started to use them in some object detection applications. Because there are many versions of the YOLO model (currently the latest one is YoloV9) is somehow hard to decide which one fits best for a certaion application so i tested each model starting with version 5 to version 9. When i say that i tested i refer to the fact tha
In this repository i colected six YOLO models (YoloV5,YoloV6.YoloV7.YoloV8 and YoloV9).
